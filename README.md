# Computational Task ELMASE

Download everything [as a ZIP file](https://github.com/tovrstra/cte/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

To run this notebook in your browser, [Open the notebook in Google Colab ![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tovrstra/cte/blob/main/demo.ipynb) (Code execution requires a Google account.)

Also a Matlab version of the same code is provided in [demo.m](demo.m).
It does not contain the presentation, just the Matlab translation of the code in section 4 of the notebook.
The Matlab version was tested with Matlab 9_11.
One of the (many) unfortunate peculiarities of Matlab is that the functions have to be defined at the end of the script.
Keep this in mind when you try to understand how it works.
